Hello! This page is under construction. I want to share my research and projects on this page. Please come back in a couple of days!

I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics program at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Dr. [Yue Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dDPQH3oAAAAJ&hl=en) in the [BM2 Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/labbm2/). I received my M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, and my B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Bu Ali Sina University.

I design, build, model, control, and integrate robotic systems for various applications. My primary objective is to develop innovative control methods that synergize model-based and learning approaches. My research interests include Adaptive Control, Control Theory, Learning-Based Control, Optimal Control, Trajectory Optimization, Robot Learning, Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Optimization, with a current focus on applications in Soft Robotics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Check5

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
